// Data Context Provider

# Data Context Provider

This component provides a context for managing and accessing data within the application. It utilizes Firebase for data fetching and provides a hook (`useData`) for accessing the fetched data.

## Usage

### DataContext

The `DataContext` component creates a context to manage and provide data within the application.

### useData Hook

The `useData` hook allows components to access data from the context. It must be used within a `DataProvider` component.

### Key Points:

DataContext: Creates a context to manage and provide data within the application.
useData: Hook for accessing data from the context. It throws an error if used outside the DataProvider.
DataProvider: Component that wraps the application and provides the DataContext to its children.
